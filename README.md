# tournament-simulation

The R scripts in this repository implement a model for BPS debate tournaments.
The model is used to simulate large tournaments such as WUDC and EUDC. The 
simulation can be used to answer such questions as "How many rounds do I need
for a given number of teams so that I can be reasonably sure that the break 
includes the strongest teams?"

In the present case, the development of the model is used to simulate the 
effect of using Buchholz points to determine the fine ranking of teams instead 
of the currently used speaker points.
